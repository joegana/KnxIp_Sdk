Hi, everybody!    
Welcome to my github space.:tada:    
This is a free space, you can get everything from my space.    
    
I am interested in [KNX technology](https://www.knx.org/knx-en/index.php) which is spreading in China widely. According to KNX specification, I write a SDK of KnxIp which can be used in PC or mobile software to make a tunnelling connection with KnxIp router and transceive KnxIp frames with KnxIp router.This project is a demo example demonstrating how to use my KnxIp-SDK library in PC running windows operating system.This KnxIp-SDK library is tested completely.It can do such job as blow:    
* (1) KnxIp routers searching;
* (2) Tunnelling connection establishing and connection management;
* (3) Communication object's data reading and writing.    

I do this project just because of interest, so, if you get this library and use it, **please undertake all of the resulted in duty**. On the other hand, if you have any questions, please contact with me without any hesitant, and any idea is welcome. If you want to get some design ideas about this knxip-skd, please **refer to** [KnxIp_Sdk_Demo.c](https://github.com/qingsongcw/KnxIp_Sdk/blob/master/source/KnxIp_Sdk_Demo.c) for more information. When I write this file, design idea is depicted in it, you can get it.
